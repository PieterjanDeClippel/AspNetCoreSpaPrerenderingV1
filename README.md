# AspNetCoreSpaPrerendering
ASP.NET Core project with angular and prerendering (SSR)

## Pass data from ASP.NET Core to angular based on activated route
Please see the following repository: [MintPlayer.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Routing](https://github.com/MintPlayer/MintPlayer.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Routing)

## Project moved
This project is now maintained at the before-mentioned urls.

I created a project template at the [following url](https://github.com/MintPlayer/MintPlayer.AspNetCore.Templates#installing-the-templates). Simply install the templates, create a new project from the template, preferrably run `npm install` manually, and run the project.
